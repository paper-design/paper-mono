# About

To-Do

### Installation

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/paper-design/paper-mono/releases/latest) and install the fonts on your system.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://paper-design.github.io/paper-mono.
